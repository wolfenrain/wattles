# Overview ðŸŽ¯

Wattle(s) is a strongly typed Dart ORM that does not require code generation. It is inspired by many tools including [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/), [Mikro ORM](https://mikro-orm.io/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

The goal of Wattle(s) is to help developers talk to their databases while using a strongly typed API. Wattle(s) main focus is to be a true ORM, create a virtual object database that maps the data to schemas while keeping relations intact. It does not, however, provide a way to create custom queries specifically tailored to your use case or create migrations for your database.
